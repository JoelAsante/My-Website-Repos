            Joel Asante is my name. Am from Kansas City, Kansas and am a junior majoring in Computer Science at
            Wichita State University where I plan on graduating in the Spring
            2021. I have always enjoyed every aspect about computers and that's
            one of the reasons why I majored in CS. My favorite courses I have
            taking in CS so far are: Data Structures, Object Oriented
            Programming. My future goal is to be a Software Enginner after
            graduation where I hope to apply my skills learned during my time at school
